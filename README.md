# vimflash
Simple [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net)-inspired application used to learn and 
retain vim keybinds. The general concept behind this is repitition - any binds
that aren't retained get tested again earlier than those that are. Also I 
wanted to finally learn rust.

## TODO

[ ] Create project structure
[ ] Customizable backend DB
[ ] Use existing vim config for custom binds
[ ] CI/CD
